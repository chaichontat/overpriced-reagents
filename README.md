  ```
  25 mM Sodium Citrate pH 5.2
  10 mM EDTA
  70% ammonium sulfate
  ```
  
  Citrate and EDTA chelates divalent ions, which accelerate DNA/RNA hydrolysis. 70% (NH4)2SO4 precipitates all proteins, including RNAses. RNA is the most stable at pH 5.

  [ElectroLigase®](https://www.neb.com/products/m0369-electroligase)
  - No PEG
  - T4 buffer + 12% 1,2Pr-D
  
  > When PEG is present in the ligase buffer, a two-fold reduction in the small molecule enhancer concentration over that used in the absence of PEG can be used to further enhance ligation over that seen with PEG alone
  > An improvement of at least 25% in efficiency of ligation was observed in multiple samples in which glycerol and 1,2-PrD were included in addition to PEG 6000 compared with ligation efficiencies in the presence of PEG 6000 only as a control. When the ligated DNA was introduced into host cells using electroporation (see Example 1), at least a 50-fold improvement was observed over the control.
  
  [Instant Sticky-end Ligase Master Mix](https://www.neb.com/products/m0370-instant-sticky-end-ligase-master-mix)
  - Contains PEG
  
  [Blunt/TA Ligase Master Mix](https://www.neb.com/products/m0367-blunt-ta-ligase-master-mix)
  - Contains PEG
  - Probably different concentrations of PEG
