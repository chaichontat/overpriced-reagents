  The filter is called an extraction thimble.

  ```
  The Fiber braid of the filter material may, for example, cellulose, Be made glass, plastic and / or metal fibers. It goes without saying that too other materials that are suitable for a depth filter.

Around one for the above purpose sufficient filter capacity available should the filter material have a thickness of at least 1 mm. It is understood that the Thickness of the filter material can also be larger if appropriate capacity requirements consist.

  Silica-based kit. The magic is 5% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside in the binding buffer.
  
  > Other classes of detergents, such as zwitterionic, alkyl sulfate, CHAPS, glucamide and non-ionic polyoxyethylene, do not function in the method of the present invention to provide adequate yields of nucleic acids with low levels of endotoxins. Since endotoxins are lipopolysaccharides, it is thought that the carbohydrate component of the carbohydrate non-ionic detergents claimed in the present invention solubilizes the polysaccharide portion of the endotoxin, preventing it from absorbing to the binding matrix. Thus the nucleic acids to be purified absorb to the binding matrix in the presence of the chaotropic binding solution, whereas the endotoxins do not absorb in the presence of the carbohydrate non-ionic detergent and are washed off the binding matrix column. Other classes of detergents, other than the carbohydrate non-ionic detergents claimed in the present invention, either interfere with the binding of the nucleic acids to the binding matrix, resulting in a low yield of recovered nucleic acids and/or interfere with the solubilizing of the endotoxins, resulting in high amounts of endotoxins in the final nucleic acid product.

  To make the most sense, the gel beads probably decompose upon mixing with the RT mix containing DTT.
  This allows oligos to bind to mRNAs within a fixed cells.
  
  Emulsion formation, probably based on [this](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2008/LC/b806706f) paper.

  [ElectroLigase®](https://www.neb.com/products/m0369-electroligase)
  - No PEG
  - T4 buffer + 12% 1,2Pr-D
  
  > When PEG is present in the ligase buffer, a two-fold reduction in the small molecule enhancer concentration over that used in the absence of PEG can be used to further enhance ligation over that seen with PEG alone
  > An improvement of at least 25% in efficiency of ligation was observed in multiple samples in which glycerol and 1,2-PrD were included in addition to PEG 6000 compared with ligation efficiencies in the presence of PEG 6000 only as a control. When the ligated DNA was introduced into host cells using electroporation (see Example 1), at least a 50-fold improvement was observed over the control.
  
  [Instant Sticky-end Ligase Master Mix](https://www.neb.com/products/m0370-instant-sticky-end-ligase-master-mix)
